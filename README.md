# Hello, I'm DJ Reynald Martinez! 👋

## 🏗️ Background

I began my career as an **electronics engineer**, working extensively in control systems and automation, designing and implementing solutions for various industries like water treatment, bottling, and manufacturing. Over time, I discovered my passion for software development, particularly in creating scalable and efficient systems. This passion led me to transition into **back-end development**, where I now specialize in building robust APIs and microservices.

Now, as a back-end developer, I create APIs and microservices using **NestJS**, **MongoDB**, **SQL**, **TypeScript**, and **Kafka**, while leveraging the cloud with **AWS**. I bring a unique perspective to my software development projects, drawing from my hands-on experience with hardware, electronics, and automation systems.

## 🛠 Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C++
- **Frameworks**: NestJS, Express
- **Databases**: MongoDB, SQL, Redis
- **Tools**: Kafka, AWS, Docker
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Prototyping**: PLC, Arduino, Raspberry Pi

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

- Improving scalability for microservices with Kafka and AWS.
- Exploring advanced CI/CD pipelines with Docker and GitHub Actions.
